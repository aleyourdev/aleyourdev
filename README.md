# Hi, I'm [insert your name] ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and my goal is to become a full stack developer. I like to learn and use the most popular frameworks today for backend and frontend, such as **Angular**, **Spring Boot**, **Next.js**, **Django** and many others[^2^][1]. I'm also passionate about video game programming and I've made some projects with **Unity** and **Unreal Engine**.

I like to collaborate in many interesting and innovative projects, such as **Material Design 3** for the web, which offers a new visual and interactive experience for users[^1^][2].

If you want to know more about me and my work, you can contact me at [insert your email] or check out my GitHub profile [insert your link].

Thank you for visiting my profile and have a nice day! ðŸ˜Š
