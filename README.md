# Hi, I'm Alessandro Caramia ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and my goal is to become a full stack developer. I like to learn and use the most popular frameworks today for backend and frontend, such as **Express**, **Angular**, **Spring Boot**, **Next.js**, **Django** and many others. I'm also passionate about video game programming and I've made some projects with **Unity**. ðŸŽ®

I want to collaborate in many interesting and innovative projects, such as **[MonoGame](https://github.com/MonoGame/MonoGame)** for the game development, and I want to propose my personal projects. ðŸŒŸ
